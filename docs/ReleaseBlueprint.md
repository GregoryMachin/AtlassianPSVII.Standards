# AtlassianPS Release Blueprint

This document is the canonical release blueprint for AtlassianPS PowerShell modules.
Module repositories may keep short local runbooks, but cross-repository release strategy belongs here.

## Goals

- Keep release workflows predictable across AtlassianPS modules.
- Reuse shared Standards primitives instead of copying release logic into each repository.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub release bodies, and PSGallery manifest `PrivateData.PSData.ReleaseNotes` synchronized.
- Fail release-note and tag validation before publishing immutable PSGallery packages.
- Make workflow drift visible in tests.

## Version And Changelog Contract

Use one `v`-prefixed three-part version everywhere a release is identified.

| Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Git tag | `vX.Y.Z` | `v3.0.0` |
| Changelog heading | `## vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` | `## v3.0.0 - 2026-05-10` |
| Module manifest | `X.Y.Z` | `ModuleVersion = '3.0.0'` |

Pre-release tags may append a prerelease label, for example `v3.1.0-beta`.
The module manifest keeps the numeric version in `ModuleVersion` and uses `PrivateData.PSData.Prerelease` for the prerelease label where needed.

The release notes parser preserves the full markdown body under the matching `##` heading until the next `##` heading.
Introductory paragraphs before `###` sections are supported and are included in both PSGallery and GitHub release notes.

## Required Release Flow

Release workflows should do these steps in order:

1. Check out the repository with full history.
2. Resolve and validate the annotated release tag with `resolve-release-tag`.
3. Download the CI `Release` artifact built from the tagged commit.
4. Set up PowerShell dependencies with `setup-powershell`.
5. Build `Release/release-notes.md` from `CHANGELOG.md` with `build-release-notes`.
6. Publish the module, with manifest release notes generated from the same changelog section.
7. Create the GitHub release with `body_path` pointing at `Release/release-notes.md`.

Release notes must be built before publishing.
If the changelog section is missing or empty, the workflow must fail before PSGallery receives the package.

## Required Shared Actions

Pin all Standards actions to the same released commit SHA and include a version comment.

```yaml
- name: Validate release tag
  id: release_ref
  uses: AtlassianPS/AtlassianPS.Standards/.github/actions/resolve-release-tag@<standards-sha> # v0.1.11

- uses: AtlassianPS/AtlassianPS.Standards/.github/actions/setup-powershell@<standards-sha> # v0.1.11

- uses: AtlassianPS/AtlassianPS.Standards/.github/actions/build-release-notes@<standards-sha> # v0.1.11
  id: release_notes
  with:
    release-version: ${{ steps.release_ref.outputs.release_tag }}
```

GitHub releases should use the generated file path:

```yaml
- name: Create Release and Upload Asset
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v3
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ steps.release_ref.outputs.release_tag }}
    name: ${{ steps.release_ref.outputs.release_tag }}
    body_path: ${{ steps.release_notes.outputs.release_notes_path }}
```

Do not use `MatteoCampinoti94/changelog-to-release` or repo-local changelog formatting configuration.
GitHub release notes and PSGallery manifest release notes should be the same source text, not independently formatted variants.

## Required Build Script Pattern

The publish path should use the Standards parser for manifest release notes.

```powershell
Task SetVersion {
    $releaseNotes = Get-AtlassianPSReleaseNotesFromChangelog `
        -ChangelogPath (Join-Path -Path $env:BHProjectPath -ChildPath 'CHANGELOG.md') `
        -ReleaseVersion $script:BuildInfo.VersionToPublish

    $null = Set-AtlassianPSModuleManifestVersion `
        -BuiltManifestPath $builtManifestPath `
        -ModuleName $env:BHProjectName `
        -VersionToPublish $VersionToPublish `
        -ReleaseNotes $releaseNotes
}
```

Keep repository build orchestration local.
Use Standards for small primitives and shared actions, not for broad module-specific release wrappers.

## Drift Guards

Each module should include guard tests that enforce the blueprint.
At minimum, test that:

- `Tools/build.requirements.psd1` pins `AtlassianPS.Standards` to the intended version.
- Every `AtlassianPS.Standards/.github/actions/*` workflow reference is pinned to a 40-character commit SHA.
- Every Standards action pin uses the same version comment as `Tools/build.requirements.psd1`.
- The release workflow uses `build-release-notes`.
- The release workflow uses `body_path: ${{ steps.release_notes.outputs.release_notes_path }}`.
- The release workflow builds release notes before publishing.
- The build script uses `Get-AtlassianPSReleaseNotesFromChangelog` for manifest release notes.
- The repository does not contain `changelog-to-release`, `.github/changelog.configuration.json`, or copied inline parser/write-file plumbing.

JiraPS is the reference implementation for these guard tests.
Future Standards work may consolidate the checks into a shared `Test-AtlassianPSReleaseBlueprint` command.

## Migration Checklist

For each existing module repository:

1. Bump `Tools/build.requirements.psd1` to the current `AtlassianPS.Standards` version.
2. Pin all Standards workflow actions to the same release commit SHA.
3. Replace local release-tag scripts with `resolve-release-tag`.
4. Replace third-party or inline GitHub release-note generation with `build-release-notes`.
5. Remove `.github/changelog.configuration.json` when it only served the old changelog action.
6. Update `softprops/action-gh-release` to use `body_path` from the shared action output.
7. Replace local changelog parsers in build scripts with `Get-AtlassianPSReleaseNotesFromChangelog`.
8. Add or update drift guard tests.
9. Update the local release runbook to link back to this blueprint.
10. Run local workflow syntax, guard tests, lint, build/test, and release metadata preflight before pushing.

## Local Release Preflight

Before creating a release tag, run the module's normal build/test gate and verify release metadata for the exact tag.

```powershell
Invoke-Build -Task Build, Test
Invoke-Build -Task Build, SetVersion -VersionToPublish vX.Y.Z
```

If the second command cannot find a matching changelog section, do not tag the release.

## Common Mistakes

- Creating a non-annotated release tag.
- Tagging a commit that is not reachable from `origin/master`.
- Using `## X.Y.Z` in the changelog while tagging `vX.Y.Z`.
- Using two-part tags for one repo and three-part tags for another.
- Publishing with GitHub release notes generated from a different parser than PSGallery release notes.
- Publishing before building release notes from the changelog.
- Fixing GitHub release notes after PSGallery publish and assuming package metadata changed too.

Published PSGallery package metadata is immutable.
The release workflow must get release notes right before publishing.
